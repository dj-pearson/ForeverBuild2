# ForeverBuild Roblox Interaction System Fix

## Understanding Roblox Path Structure

Based on the `second.project.json` file and the actual structure seen in your game, here's how the folders are mapped:

1. `src/shared` → `ReplicatedStorage.shared`
2. `src/server` → `ServerScriptService.server`
3. `src/client` → `StarterPlayer.StarterPlayerScripts.client`
4. `src/StarterGui` → `StarterGui.StarterGui`

When the game is running, the `client` scripts from StarterPlayerScripts get copied to `Players.[PlayerName].PlayerScripts`.

## Issue Summary

The issue with the interaction system was that it couldn't find the required modules and dependencies. The original scripts were:

1. Using incorrect paths to access the modules
2. Missing proper fallbacks for when modules weren't available
3. Not handling path differences between Studio edit mode and runtime

## Fixed Scripts

The following scripts have been created to fix these issues:

### 1. INSTALL_FIXED_INTERACTION_MODULE_ROBLOX_UPDATED.lua

This script installs the fixed interaction module into both:
- StarterPlayerScripts (for future players)
- Current player's PlayerScripts (for immediate use)

It creates the necessary folder structure and properly handles paths based on your actual Roblox environment.

### 2. VALIDATE_FIXED_INTERACTION_MODULE_ROBLOX_UPDATED.lua

This script checks if the module was installed correctly by:
- Searching for the module in multiple locations
- Trying to require it
- Checking if it has all required methods
- Counting interactable objects in your World_Items folder

### 3. MAKE_OBJECTS_INTERACTABLE.lua

This utility script helps you mark objects as interactable:
- Select objects in Studio
- Run the script
- It adds the Interactable attribute and sets InteractionType
- Moves objects to the World_Items folder if needed

## How to Use These Scripts

### Step 1: Run the Structure Mapper

First, run `ROBLOX_STRUCTURE_MAPPER.lua` in the Command Bar in Play mode to see your actual game structure.

### Step 2: Install the Fixed Module

Run `INSTALL_FIXED_INTERACTION_MODULE_ROBLOX_UPDATED.lua` in the Command Bar in Play mode. This will:
- Install the module to both runtime and starter locations
- Set up global access via _G.InteractionSystem
- Print detailed logs of what it's doing

### Step 3: Validate the Installation

Run `VALIDATE_FIXED_INTERACTION_MODULE_ROBLOX_UPDATED.lua` in the Command Bar to check if everything installed correctly.

### Step 4: Make Objects Interactable

1. Select objects in your workspace
2. Run `MAKE_OBJECTS_INTERACTABLE.lua` in the Command Bar
3. Enter `1` to make the selected objects interactable
4. Or enter `2` to see all currently interactable objects

## Requirements for Interactable Objects

For an object to be interactable, it needs:

1. The `Interactable` attribute set to `true`
2. An `InteractionType` attribute ("PICKUP", "USE", or "CUSTOMIZE")
3. To be located in the `Workspace.World_Items` folder
4. If it's a model, it needs a PrimaryPart assigned

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Module Not Found
- Check if the module installed correctly using the validation script
- Make sure you're running the game in Play mode when installing

### Interactions Not Working
- Run the MAKE_OBJECTS_INTERACTABLE.lua script to verify objects are properly set up
- Check if objects have the Interactable attribute
- Make sure models have a PrimaryPart assigned

### SharedModule Issues
- The fixed module includes fallbacks when SharedModule isn't available
- Check if ReplicatedStorage.shared exists and has the right structure

## Next Steps for Further Improvement

1. Create a proper module reloading system for easier updates
2. Add better debugging and visualization tools
3. Create a configuration system for interaction settings
4. Improve the UI/UX for interaction prompts
