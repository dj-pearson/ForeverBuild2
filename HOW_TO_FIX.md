# How to Fix ForeverBuild Game Issues

This document explains how to use the `FixGameIssues.lua` script to resolve the current problems in your ForeverBuild game.

## Current Issues

1. **Missing core Folder**: Your shared module is looking for a core folder that doesn't exist, causing this error:

   ```
   core is not a valid member of ReplicatedStorage "ReplicatedStorage"
   ```

2. **Missing Remote Events**: Some required remote events are missing, including "InteractWithItem".

3. **Syntax Error in "Thank you letter" Script**: There's an invalid script in `Workspace.World_Items.Rare House.House.Cute Closet.#NBK || Adidas Cap.Thank you letter`.

## Solution: Run the Fix Script

Follow these steps to run the fix script in Roblox Studio:

1. **Open Your Game in Roblox Studio**

2. **Insert the Fix Script**:

   - In Studio, go to the "Explorer" panel
   - Right-click on "ServerScriptService"
   - Select "Insert Object" â†’ "Script"
   - Name the script "FixGameIssues"
   - Copy and paste the entire contents of the `FixGameIssues.lua` file into this script

3. **Run the Script**:

   - Click the "Play" button in Roblox Studio (or press F5)
   - The script will automatically:
     - Create the missing "core" folder with a Constants module
     - Add all missing remote events, including "InteractWithItem"
     - Fix the "Thank you letter" script syntax error

4. **Check the Output**:

   - Open the "Output" window in Studio
   - You should see messages confirming that each fix was applied successfully

5. **Stop the Game and Save**:
   - Once the fixes are complete, stop the game
   - Save your game to preserve the changes

## After Running the Fix

After applying the fixes, your game should:

- Properly load the shared module without the "core is not a valid member" error
- Have all required remote events in ReplicatedStorage.Remotes
- No longer show syntax errors for the "Thank you letter" script

## What This Fix Does

The script fixes the issues by:

1. **Creating a proper core structure**:

   - Adds a "core" folder to ReplicatedStorage
   - Adds a Constants module to the core folder
   - Updates the shared module to check for the core folder in multiple locations

2. **Adding missing remotes**:

   - Adds the missing "InteractWithItem" remote event that was causing errors
   - Ensures all other required remotes exist

3. **Fixing syntax errors**:
   - Locates and repairs the problematic "Thank you letter" script

If you encounter any issues after running the fix script, please provide the error messages so I can help you troubleshoot further.

## For Future Development

To prevent these issues in the future:

- Use proper ModuleScript structure for shared modules
- Create all required remote events at game initialization
- Validate syntax of all scripts before publishing
