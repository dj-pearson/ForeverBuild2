# ForeverBuild Game - Interaction System

## Overview
We've rebuilt the interaction system from scratch to provide a more robust and resilient experience. The system now handles missing or broken dependencies gracefully.

## Changes Made

1. **New Interaction Modules**:
   - `ItemInteractionManager.luau` (server-side): Manages store catalog purchases and world item interactions
   - `ItemInteractionClient.luau` (client-side): Handles proximity detection and input handling
   - `CatalogItemUI.luau` (client-side): Provides UI for purchasing catalog items

2. **Improved Resilience**:
   - All modules now include fallback mechanisms for when shared dependencies fail
   - Detailed error logging to help identify and fix issues
   - Graceful degradation of functionality instead of complete failure

3. **Simplified SharedModule**:
   - Replaced complex dependency tree with straightforward structure
   - Included essential constants and stub managers
   - Removed unnecessary complexity

## Known Issues

1. **"Thank you letter" Script Syntax Error**:
   - Error: `Workspace.World_Items.Rare House.House.Cute Closet.#NBK || Adidas Cap.Thank you letter.:1: Incomplete statement: expected assignment or a function call`
   - Resolution: Use the provided `FixScriptErrors.luau` script in Studio to fix this

2. **Legacy Systems**:
   - Old interaction systems have been moved to `src/client/interaction/legacy_backup`
   - Consider removing these eventually to reduce confusion

## How to Complete Setup

1. **Fix Script Errors**:
   - Open your place in Roblox Studio
   - Create a new Script in ServerScriptService
   - Copy the contents of FixScriptErrors.luau into it
   - Run the script once to fix the problematic scripts

2. **Test in Studio**:
   - Run the game in Studio and verify that:
     - Catalog items can be viewed and "purchased"
     - World items can be interacted with (move, rotate, clone, destroy)
     - Notifications appear correctly

3. **Future Improvements**:
   - Implement proper data persistence using DataStores
   - Add more interactive features to placed items
   - Improve UI feedback and animations
