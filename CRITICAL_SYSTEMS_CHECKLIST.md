## 🚨 **Game-Breaking Issues to Address**

### **1. Memory Leaks** 💥

**Problem:** Objects never truly deleted, memory grows infinitely
**Solution:** Proper cleanup in PlacementTracker removal

```lua
function PlacementTracker:RemoveObject(placementId)
    -- Remove from all tracking structures
    local placement = self.placedObjects[placementId]
    if placement then
        -- Remove from grid
        local gridPos = self:WorldToGrid(placement.Position)
        local gridKey = gridPos.x .. "," .. gridPos.z
        if self.occupiedRegions[gridKey] then
            for i, id in ipairs(self.occupiedRegions[gridKey]) do
                if id == placementId then
                    table.remove(self.occupiedRegions[gridKey], i)
                    break
                end
            end
        end

        -- Remove from cache
        self.placedObjects[placementId] = nil
    end
end
```

### **2. Performance Degradation** 📉

**Problem:** FPS drops to unplayable levels with many objects
**Solution:** LOD system and streaming (already created)

### **3. Data Loss Scenarios** 🗂️

**Problem:** Server crashes can lose hours of player work
**Solution:** Frequent incremental saves

```lua
-- Save every 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes
function PlacementTracker:StartAutoSave()
    spawn(function()
        while true do
            wait(30) -- Frequent saves
            self:SaveIncrementalChanges()
        end
    end)
end
```

### **4. Exploit Vulnerabilities** 🕳️

**Problem:** Players can duplicate items, bypass costs, etc.
**Solution:** Server-side validation of EVERYTHING

```lua
function PlacementManager:ValidatePlacement(player, itemId, position)
    -- Check player owns item
    if not InventoryManager:PlayerHasItem(player, itemId) then
        return false, "Item not owned"
    end

    -- Check position is valid
    if not self:IsValidPosition(position) then
        return false, "Invalid position"
    end

    -- Check rate limits
    if moderationSystem:CheckPlacement(player, position, itemId) then
        return false, "Rate limited"
    end

    return true
end
```

## 💡 **Key Insights for Your Game**

### **1. Performance is King** 👑

With building games, performance degrades quickly:

- **50 objects:** No issues
- **200 objects:** Slight lag
- **500 objects:** Noticeable problems
- **1000+ objects:** Unplayable without optimization

### **2. Data Loss = Player Loss** 💔

Players invest hours building. One data loss incident can kill your game permanently. **Backup everything, frequently.**

### **3. Moderation is Essential** 🚫

Building games attract griefers. You need:

- Automated detection (spam, inappropriate content)
- Quick response tools for admins
- Fair punishment systems
- Player reporting mechanisms

### **4. Economic Balance** ⚖️

Track your economy closely:

- Coin generation vs spending
- Item value inflation
- Player spending patterns
- Economic exploits

---

## 🎯 **Success Metrics to Track**

### **Technical Health**

- Server FPS consistently >30
- Memory usage <800MB
- <5% crash rate
- <2 second average response time

### **Player Experience**

- > 70% player retention after first day
- <1% players report moderation issues
- Average session time >20 minutes
- > 80% positive feedback on building experience

### **Economic Health**

- Inflation rate <5% monthly
- 60-80% of earned coins get spent
- No item duplication exploits
- Fair distribution of premium items

_Remember: A solid foundation prevents technical debt that becomes impossible to fix later. Implement these systems early!_
