## 🏗️ **Architecture Evolution**

### Before Phase 2:
```
Interaction System:
├── InteractionSystemWrapper.luau (253 lines, custom patterns)
├── Complex fallback logic in client_core.luau
├── 6+ different interaction modules
└── Inconsistent with currency system

Currency System:
├── CurrencySystemWrapper.luau (179 lines, standardized)
├── Clean API calls in client_core.luau
└── BaseSystemWrapper inheritance
```

### After Phase 2:
```
Unified Architecture:
├── BaseSystemWrapper.luau (380 lines, reusable)
├── SystemConfig.luau (350 lines, centralized)
├── CurrencySystemWrapper.luau (179 lines, standardized)
├── InteractionSystemWrapper.luau (280 lines, standardized)
├── client_core.luau (clean API calls for both systems)
└── 100% consistent patterns across systems
```

## 🔧 **Technical Benefits Achieved**

### 1. **System Consistency**
- **Unified Patterns**: Both systems inherit from `BaseSystemWrapper`
- **Consistent APIs**: Same method signatures and behavior
- **Shared Configuration**: Single source of truth for all settings

### 2. **Developer Experience**
- **Faster Development**: Copy-paste pattern from currency to interaction
- **Easier Debugging**: Consistent logging across all systems
- **Better Testing**: Same health monitoring for all systems
- **Clear Documentation**: Standardized patterns are self-documenting

### 3. **System Reliability**
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Built into every system wrapper
- **Health Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring for all systems
- **Error Recovery**: Standardized retry and recovery mechanisms
- **Graceful Degradation**: Systems automatically switch to fallbacks
