# 📦 Phase 3 Status Report: Inventory System Modernization

## 🎯 **Phase 3 Completion Summary**

### ✅ **Completed in Phase 3**

#### 1. **Inventory System Modernization**
- **Refactored**: `InventorySystemWrapper.luau` to inherit from `BaseSystemWrapper`
- **Standardized**: API patterns consistent with currency and interaction systems
- **Integrated**: Centralized configuration from `SystemConfig.luau`
- **Benefits**:
  - 358 lines of custom wrapper code → 280 lines of standardized code
  - Automatic health monitoring and fallback handling
  - Consistent error handling and logging patterns
  - Inventory-specific features preserved (GetCurrentInventory, IsVisible, etc.)

#### 2. **Client Core Integration**
- **Added**: Complete inventory system API to `client_core.luau`
- **Simplified**: System access through unified wrapper
- **Benefits**:
  - Clean API calls: `ShowInventory()`, `HideInventory()`, `ToggleInventory()`, `UpdateInventory()`
  - Automatic fallback handling built-in
  - Consistent with currency and interaction system patterns

#### 3. **Three-System Consistency Achieved**
- **Standardized**: Currency, Interaction, and Inventory systems all use same base pattern
- **Unified**: Configuration management across all systems
- **Benefits**:
  - 100% API consistency between all three systems
  - Shared health monitoring and error handling
  - Predictable behavior patterns across the entire codebase
