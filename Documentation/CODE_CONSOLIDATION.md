# Consolidation of Admin and Purchase Handler Scripts

## What Changed?

We've consolidated three scripts into a single, more maintainable script:
1. `ItemPurchaseHandler.lua` (old .lua version)
2. `ItemPurchaseHandler.luau` (newer .luau version)
3. `AdminCurrencyManager.lua` (admin currency functionality)

## Why?

- **Reduced Redundancy**: Multiple files were handling similar functionality with overlapping code
- **Improved Admin Detection**: Added hardcoded admin IDs for reliable admin checks even if Constants fails to load
- **Better Debugging**: Added detailed logging to trace issues with admin commands
- **Consistent Code Style**: Now using the newer .luau file format for all scripts

## Key Features of the Consolidated Script

1. **Improved Admin Detection**
   - Hardcoded admin IDs as a fallback mechanism
   - Detailed debug logging of admin checks
   - Support for detecting admins by ID and name

2. **Complete Admin Commands**
   - `/addadmincurrency` command is now handled entirely in one place
   - Automatically connects to both new and existing players

3. **Robust Error Handling**
   - Proper imports with fallbacks if modules fail to load
   - Better error checking and reporting

## Backup

Original files are safely backed up in `backup_20250519_102450/` folder:
- `ItemPurchaseHandler.lua.bak`
- `AdminCurrencyManager.lua.bak`

## How to Test

1. Join your game
2. Use the `/addadmincurrency` command
3. Check the Output window for detailed logs
4. Verify that you receive the currency if you're an admin

If you need to restore the original files, you can find them in the backup folder.
