# Interaction System Fixes

## Issues Identified

Based on the debug output in `RobloxOutput.txt`, we identified the following issues:

1. **Missing Remote Events/Functions**: The most critical issue was the error:
   ```
   GetAvailableInteractions is not a valid member of Folder "ReplicatedStorage.Remotes"
   ```
   This was occurring because the `GetAvailableInteractions` RemoteFunction was not being created during server initialization.

2. **Error Handling**: The client-side code wasn't robust enough to handle missing remote events/functions, causing errors when interacting with objects.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Server Initialization (`inits.server.luau`)

The updated server initialization script now:

- Creates all necessary RemoteEvents and RemoteFunctions, including:
  - `GetAvailableInteractions`
  - `CloneItem`
  - `PickupItem`
  - `AddToInventory`
  - `GetItemData`
  - `ApplyItemEffect`

- Properly initializes the `InteractionManager` and sets up its event handlers

- Adds server-side handlers for all remote events to ensure they function correctly

### 2. Client Interaction System (`InteractionSystemModule.lua`)

The updated client interaction system now:

- Adds error handling for missing remote events/functions
- Provides fallback behaviors when remotes aren't available
- Adds local notification capability to inform the user when server operations can't be completed
- Implements the `SetupInventoryKey` method for toggling inventory (I key)
- Improves robustness of mouse target detection and interaction

## How to Apply the Fixes

1. Run the `apply_fixes.ps1` script to automatically apply the fixes:
   ```powershell
   .\apply_fixes.ps1
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Create backups of your original files
   - Copy the fixed versions to the correct locations

2. Build your project using Rojo:
   ```powershell
   rojo build second.project.json -o ForeverBuild.rbxm
   ```

3. Test in Roblox Studio

## Verification

After applying the fixes, the interaction system should now:

1. Properly detect and highlight objects when hovering over them
2. Allow clicking on objects to interact with them
3. Handle the case when remote events/functions are missing (graceful degradation)
4. Show notifications for interactions
5. Support inventory toggling with the I key

## Troubleshooting

If you continue to experience issues:

1. Check the Output window in Roblox Studio for any errors
2. Verify that the `Remotes` folder exists in `ReplicatedStorage` and contains all expected remote events/functions
3. Make sure the InteractionManager is properly initialized and responding to remote calls
4. Check that your server-side handlers for remotes are correctly implemented

You can revert to the original files by copying the `.bak` files back to their original names if needed.
