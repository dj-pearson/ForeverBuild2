# Client Initialization File Merge Resolution

## The Issue

There was a conflict between two versions of the client initialization file:
- `init.client.luau` (original name)
- `inits.client.luau` (new standardized naming convention for Rojo compatibility)

This caused source control merge conflicts when trying to select the correct version.

## The Solution

We've resolved this by:

1. Merging the best functionality from both files into a single, improved `inits.client.luau`
2. Standardizing on the `inits.client.luau` naming pattern for consistency with other init files
3. Removing the redundant `init.client.luau` file

The merged file now includes:
- Proper initialization of the LazyLoadModules system
- Appropriate registration of modules to prevent circular dependencies
- Enhanced error handling for module loading
- Consolidated UI initialization through the client_core module
- Clean, consistent logging

## Implementation

A script has been provided to handle this merge automatically:
```powershell
.\resolve_client_merge.ps1
```

This script:
- Creates backups of both original files (in case you need to revert)
- Applies the merged file to `inits.client.luau`
- Removes `init.client.luau`
- Cleans up temporary files

## Naming Convention

For future reference, our standardized naming scheme is:
- `inits.luau`: Shared initialization modules
- `inits.client.luau`: Client-side initialization modules
- `inits.server.luau`: Server-side initialization modules

This naming convention helps maintain clarity and consistency across the codebase and works better with Rojo's syncing capabilities.

## After Applying the Fix

After running the script:
1. Check that the game functions correctly in Studio
2. Ensure source control recognizes the changes correctly
3. Commit the changes with a message like "Standardized client initialization file naming and merged features"
