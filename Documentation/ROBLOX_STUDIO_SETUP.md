# Roblox Studio Script Setup Instructions

## Current Structure and Correct Setup

Based on your Roblox Studio Explorer screenshot, the structure is:

```
StarterPlayer
└── StarterPlayerScripts
    └── client (LocalScript)
        ├── Currency (Folder)
        └── interaction (Folder)
            └── InteractionSystem (ModuleScript)
        └── client (ModuleScript)
```

## How the Scripts Should Work

1. **Current Script Structure**:
   - The `client` LocalScript is already correctly placed in `StarterPlayerScripts`
   - The `interaction` folder is correctly placed inside the `client` LocalScript
   - The `InteractionSystem` module is correctly placed inside the `interaction` folder

2. **Script Paths in Roblox Studio Should Be**:
   - The client LocalScript accesses the interaction module with: `require(script.interaction.InteractionSystem)`
   - Any StarterGui scripts should run separately in their own container

3. **Debugging**:
   - The scripts now have debug print statements at the beginning to help identify if they're running
   - You should see these messages in the Output window:
     - "Client script starting..."
     - "InteractionSystem module loading..."
     - "Client initialized successfully"

4. **If Still Not Working**:
   - Check that all scripts are enabled (right-click > Properties > Enabled = true)
   - Verify that all necessary RemoteEvents are present in ReplicatedStorage
   - Ensure the `shared` module exists in ReplicatedStorage and is working correctly
   - Make sure the scripts have permission to run (security settings)

## Checking ReplicatedStorage Structure

Make sure that your ReplicatedStorage contains:
- A `shared` module that can be required by other scripts
- All necessary RemoteEvents for client-server communication

This structure ensures that all client-side scripts have access to the modules and events they need.
