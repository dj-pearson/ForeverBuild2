# Interaction System Fix

## Problem Fixed

There was an issue with the interaction system in ForeverBuild where the `BindToClose` function was being incorrectly used in a client-side script. The `BindToClose` function is only meant to be used in server scripts, not client scripts, which was causing errors.

## Changes Made

1. Removed the `BindToClose` call from the interaction system client-side module
2. Replaced it with proper event handling using the `PlayerRemoving` event
3. Added proper connection tracking and cleanup to prevent memory leaks
4. Updated the client_core.luau file to prioritize loading the fixed InteractionSystemModule

## Technical Details

The original error occurred in `InteractionSystemModule.lua` where the client-side script was using `game:BindToClose()`. This has been replaced with a proper cleanup mechanism using the `PlayerRemoving` event.

All event connections are now properly tracked in a `connections` table and are properly disconnected when the player leaves the game, preventing memory leaks and ensuring clean resource management.

Additionally, the client_core.luau file has been updated to prioritize loading the original InteractionSystemModule (which is now fixed) rather than looking for alternative versions with "_fixed" or "_emergency" suffixes.

## Testing

After these changes, the interaction system should work correctly without the previous errors. When a player leaves the game, all resources will be properly cleaned up through the `PlayerRemoving` event rather than through the server-only `BindToClose` function.
