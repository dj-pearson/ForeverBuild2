## Installation Instructions

Two methods are provided for installing the fixed interaction system:

### Method 1: Using the Installation Script
1. In Roblox Studio, open the Command Bar (View > Command Bar)
2. Run: `require(workspace.INSTALL_FIXED_MODULE)`
3. The script will:
   - Locate the fixed module
   - Replace the original module
   - Create a backup of the original

### Method 2: Manual Installation
1. Locate `src/client/interaction/InteractionSystemModule_fixed.lua`
2. Copy its contents
3. Replace the contents of `src/client/interaction/InteractionSystemModule.lua`

## Testing the Fixes

A test script is provided to verify the interaction system works correctly:

1. In Roblox Studio, open the Command Bar (View > Command Bar)
2. Run: `require(workspace.TEST_INTERACTION_SYSTEM)`
3. This will:
   - Create a test item in the workspace
   - Set up the necessary remote events
   - Initialize the interaction system

After running, hover over the test item (blue platform) and press E to test interactions.

## Further Improvements (Potential)

1. **Controller Support**: Add gamepad/controller support for interactions
2. **Mobile Touch Support**: Enhance mobile device support with touch interactions
3. **Accessibility Features**: Add color blindness support and screen reader compatibility
4. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce UI creation/destruction overhead
5. **Saved Preferences**: Allow players to customize interaction settings

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues after installing the fixes:

1. **Remote Events Missing**: Check if all required remote events exist in ReplicatedStorage.Remotes
2. **Initialization Failure**: Check if the interaction system is being initialized correctly in client_core
3. **UI Not Showing**: Verify that the player character and HumanoidRootPart exist
4. **E Key Not Working**: Check if another system is capturing the E key input

For continued assistance, check the debug logs by setting DEBUG_VERBOSE to true at the top of the InteractionSystemModule.
